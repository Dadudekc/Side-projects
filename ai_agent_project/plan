Below is an **updated plan** that incorporates the goal of **refactoring old agent files** as a top priority. We maintain the **Autonomous Test-Driven Development (TTDD)** structureâ€”ensuring each refactored agent is fully tested and integrated before moving on.

# **ðŸš€ Updated Plan for AI Agent Project**

## **1. Refactor Old Agents & Integrate into New Structure**
Since **migrating existing agents** is your top priority, weâ€™ll focus on **refactoring** the old files into the new, modular design. Each agent will follow **TTDD**:

1. **Red** â€“ Write failing tests for the old agent file.
2. **Green** â€“ Implement or refactor the agentâ€™s code until all tests pass.
3. **Refactor** â€“ Clean up and optimize the agent.

**Agents to Migrate** (in suggested order):
1. **DebuggerAgent** â€“ Aids in debugging logs and issues.  
2. **TradingAgent** â€“ Implements trading logic (e.g., MACD strategies).  
3. **AIAgentWithMemory** â€“ Adds advanced memory recall.  
4. **AgentPlanner** â€“ Coordinates multi-step tasks.

Each agent, once migrated, should have:
- **Corresponding test files** (e.g., `test_debugger_agent.py`).
- Clean, maintainable structure in the new `/agents/` folder.
- Integration with the existing `AgentDispatcher` if it needs to receive tasks.

---

## **2. Maintain & Enhance Core Infrastructure**
After each agent is migrated and tested, revisit **`AgentDispatcher.py`** and **`AgentRegistry.py`** to ensure they support:
- **Multi-agent workflows** (chaining tasks across different agents).
- **Task prioritization** (if some tasks are urgent vs. background).
- **Load/unload agents dynamically** if your use case demands it.

---

## **3. Provide a Showcase Feature**
Once **at least one agent** (e.g., **TradingAgent** or **DebuggerAgent**) is fully functional, we can **showcase** how the system works end-to-end:

1. **Write a simple script or UI** that dispatches a real task (e.g., debugging logs or analyzing a trading strategy).
2. **Demonstrate** how tasks are routed, executed, and how results are returned.

This ensures you have a **tangible, working product** to demonstrate or iterate on.

---

## **4. Expand Feature Set & Plugins**
With the core system stable:
1. **Add new plugins** (Task Scheduler, Promptsmith, etc.).
2. **Incorporate advanced ML** (e.g., memory-based improvements).
3. **Build out the REST API** in the `/api/` folder for external interactions.
4. **Create a web-based dashboard** for real-time monitoring of agents if desired.

---

## **5. Final Testing & Deployment**
- **Integrate all features** for an end-to-end system.
- **Run performance, load, and reliability tests**.
- **Package and deploy** to your preferred environment (local server, cloud, etc.).

---

# **âœ… Next Action Items**
1. **Select the next old agent file** to migrate (`DebuggerAgent.py` or `TradingAgent.py`).  
2. **Create a matching test file** (RED).  
3. **Refactor the agent** until all tests pass (GREEN).  
4. **Optimize code structure** (REFACTOR).  
5. **Repeat** for each additional agent.

This approach keeps you **organized, test-focused, and delivering** working code at every step!
