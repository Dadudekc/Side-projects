"""

A GraphMemory class which manipulates and stores knowledge data in a graph-like structure using the Networkx library.

Attributes: 
-----------
graph : nx.DiGraph
    An instance of a directed graph from the Networkx library.

Methods: 
--------
add_knowledge(subject: str, relation: str, obj: str) -> None:
    Adds a knowledge triplet {subject - relation - object} to the created graph instance.
    
get_relationships(node: str) -> list:
    Fetch all
