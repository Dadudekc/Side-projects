Project Documentation for Directory Structure Setup Tools
Project Title: Directory Structure Setup Tools

Date: 4/13/24

Version: 1.0

Author: [Victor Dixon]

1. Introduction
This document details the Directory Structure Setup Tools, comprising two components: a Graphical User Interface (GUI) application and a Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool. These tools are designed to facilitate the easy creation and management of directory structures for software development projects and other organizational needs.

2. Project Objective
The primary aim of this suite of tools is to provide flexible, user-friendly solutions for initializing and managing project directory structures. The GUI tool targets users who prefer graphical interaction, while the CLI tool caters to those who favor scriptable, command-line operations.

3. System Requirements
Operating System: Windows 10/8/7, macOS, Linux
Python Version: Python 3.6 or newer
Dependencies: PySide2, os, argparse, json, logging, treelib
4. Installation Instructions
Ensure Python 3.6+ is installed on your system.
Install required Python libraries:
bash
Copy code
pip install PySide2 treelib
Download the scripts ProjectDirSetup.py and DirectoryStructureCreator.py to your desired directory.
5. Usage Guide
GUI Tool:
Starting the Application:
bash
Copy code
python ProjectDirSetup.py
Functionalities:
Browse and set the base path for directory creation.
Add directory paths to the structure interactively.
Save and load directory setups as JSON configurations.
Create the directory structure at the specified base path.
CLI Tool:
Command Line Execution:
bash
Copy code
python DirectoryStructureCreator.py [options]
Options:
-i, --interactive: Launch in interactive mode to manually input directory paths.
-v, --verbose: Enable verbose logging.
Optionally specify a base_path and config_file directly as arguments.
6. Features
Interactive Directory Setup: Both tools allow users to dynamically configure directory structures.
Configuration Management: Ability to save and reload configurations through a JSON file.
Verbose Logging and Tree Visualization: Detailed operational logs and visual feedback of the directory structure.
7. Detailed Functionality
GUI-Based Tool:
Provides a graphical interface for all functionalities, from browsing directories to visual confirmation of structure creation.
CLI-Based Tool:
Supports both a fully interactive setup and a configuration file-driven setup.
Visualizes the directory structure upon creation using treelib.
8. Troubleshooting
Permission Issues: Ensure you have write permissions in the target directory.
Dependency Errors: Verify that all required Python packages are installed.
JSON Format Errors: Check JSON files for correct syntax if loading configurations.
9. Future Enhancements
Enhanced Cross-Platform Support: Improve compatibility and testing across different operating systems.
Extended Language Support: Localize the GUI for non-English speaking users.
Integration with Development Tools: Create plugins or extensions for popular IDEs.
