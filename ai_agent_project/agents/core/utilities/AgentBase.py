Module: AgentBase

This Python module serves as a foundational base for various agents and models in a software system. It defines essential classes for managing AI models, custom agents, debugging tools, and specific implementations of AI-driven agents for different functionalities. Primary utilities include agent registration, AI model management, and specialized agents for tasks like trading and journaling. It also includes AI model classes tailored to different purposes or algorithms, such as DeepSeekModel and MistralModel.
