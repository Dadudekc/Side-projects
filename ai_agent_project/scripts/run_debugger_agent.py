This script sets up and runs an AI-powered debugging agent. It initializes the Confidence Manager and Test Retry Manager, launching the debugging process to detect and attempt to fix failing tests with the help of AI-assisted patches. It runs the process with a retry limit of 3 tries, then logs the final results as either a success or failure. If the debugging fails, a review of log details is recommended. In the end, it provides a report of all final AI patch confidence scores for each attempted

This script runs the AI-powered debugging system:
- Detects test failures.
- Attempts to fix errors using AI-assisted patching.
- Uses confidence-based retry logic.
- Rolls back changes if all fixes fail.
- Logs debugging session results.
