# AI Architect Roadmap

## Phase 1 – Foundation
- Set up FastAPI structure and placeholder modules
- Implement basic tests for project creation

## Phase 2 – Core Features
- Integrate AI code generator and self_evolver logic
- Add service layer for model requests

## Phase 3 – Automation
- Provide bootstrap script to run self‑improvement loops
- Create deployment script and CI pipeline

## Phase 4 – Scaling
- Support multiple projects and plugin system
- Optional dashboards or CLI tools

Beta release follows Phase 3 once the system can generate a project, run tests, and redeploy itself without human intervention.
