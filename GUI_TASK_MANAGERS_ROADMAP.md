# GUI Task Managers Roadmap

## Phase 1 – Basic Functionality
- Ensure tasks can be created, edited and deleted
- Validate saving to `tasks.json` and CSV export

## Phase 2 – UI Polish
- Improve table layouts and add filtering options
- Add progress bars or status indicators

## Phase 3 – Packaging
- Bundle applications for Windows/Mac/Linux
- Write minimal documentation and test instructions

Beta release once core features work consistently across platforms and tests pass.
