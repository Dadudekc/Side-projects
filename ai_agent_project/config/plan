Below is an **updated plan** that incorporates the goal of **refactoring old agent files** as a top priority. We maintain the **Autonomous Test-Driven Development (TTDD)** structure—ensuring each refactored agent is fully tested and integrated before moving on.

---

# **🚀 Updated Plan for AI Agent Project**

## **1. Refactor Old Agents & Integrate into New Structure**
Since **migrating existing agents** is your top priority, we’ll focus on **refactoring** the old files into the new, modular design. Each agent will follow **TTDD**:

1. **Red** – Write failing tests for the old agent file.
2. **Green** – Implement or refactor the agent’s code until all tests pass.
3. **Refactor** – Clean up and optimize the agent.

**Agents to Migrate** (in suggested order):
1. **DebuggerAgent** – Aids in debugging logs and issues.  
2. **TradingAgent** – Implements trading logic (e.g., MACD strategies).  
3. **AIAgentWithMemory** – Adds advanced memory recall.  
4. **AgentPlanner** – Coordinates multi-step tasks.

Each agent, once migrated, should have:
- **Corresponding test files** (e.g., `test_debugger_agent.py`).
- Clean, maintainable structure in the new `/agents/` folder.
- Integration with the existing `AgentDispatcher` if it needs to receive tasks.

---

## **2. Maintain & Enhance Core Infrastructure**
After each agent is migrated and tested, revisit **`AgentDispatcher.py`** and **`AgentRegistry.py`** to ensure they support:
- **Multi-agent workflows** (chaining tasks across different agents).
- **Task prioritization** (if some tasks are urgent vs. background).
- **Load/unload agents dynamically** if your use case demands it.

---

## **3. Provide a Showcase Feature**
Once **at least one agent** (e.g., **TradingAgent** or **DebuggerAgent**) is fully functional, we can **showcase** how the system works end-to-end:

1. **Write a simple script or UI** that dispatches a real task (e.g., debugging logs or analyzing a trading strategy).
2. **Demonstrate** how tasks are routed, executed, and how results are returned.

This ensures you have a **tangible, working product** to demonstrate or iterate on.

---

## **4. Expand Feature Set & Plugins**
With the core system stable:
1. **Add new plugins** (Task Scheduler, Promptsmith, etc.).
2. **Incorporate advanced ML** (e.g., memory-based improvements).
3. **Build out the REST API** in the `/api/` folder for external interactions.
4. **Create a web-based dashboard** for real-time monitoring of agents if desired.

---

## **5. Final Testing & Deployment**
- **Integrate all features** for an end-to-end system.
- **Run performance, load, and reliability tests**.
- **Package and deploy** to your preferred environment (local server, cloud, etc.).

---

# **✅ Next Action Items**
1. **Select the next old agent file** to migrate (`DebuggerAgent.py` or `TradingAgent.py`).  
2. **Create a matching test file** (RED).  
3. **Refactor the agent** until all tests pass (GREEN).  
4. **Optimize code structure** (REFACTOR).  
5. **Repeat** for each additional agent.

This approach keeps you **organized, test-focused, and delivering** working code at every step!


### 🔥 **Blueprint: AI-Powered Self-Healing Debugging System**
---

### **🚀 Overview**
This project will build an **AI-powered automated debugging system** that follows **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** and **self-healing principles**. The debugger will automatically analyze failed tests, apply learned fixes, attempt AI-powered patches, and roll back changes when necessary.

---

## **🛠️ Key Features**
1. **Automated Debugging Loop**  
   - Runs tests automatically and detects failures.  
   - Parses errors and determines failure reasons.  
   - Attempts to fix issues using an adaptive **self-learning database**.  
   - If no prior fix is found, it escalates to AI-based debugging.

2. **Multi-Stage AI Debugging Pipeline**  
   - **Stage 1**: Check **past fixes** in the local database (`learning_db.json`).  
   - **Stage 2**: If no prior fix exists, attempt **LLM-powered debugging**:
     - **Mistral / DeepSeek** for local inference.
     - **Fallback to OpenAI** if local models fail.
   - **Stage 3**: If AI patch fails, **roll back changes** and retry a different approach.

3. **Test-Driven Development (TDD) Integration**  
   - Ensures that **new code is tested before deployment**.
   - Runs tests in **stages** to ensure incremental fixes.
   - Uses AI to **refactor test cases** dynamically.

4. **Self-Healing Mechanism**  
   - Stores past fixes in a **database** (`learning_db.json`).  
   - Automatically applies **known fixes** before escalating to AI.  
   - **Tracks frequent errors** and improves over time.

## **📌 How It Works**
### **🔹 Step 1: Detecting Errors**
1️⃣ `TestRunner.py` **runs all tests**.  
2️⃣ Captures **failing test cases** & extracts **error messages**.  
3️⃣ Passes errors to `DebuggerAgent.py`.

### **🔹 Step 2: Self-Healing Debugging**
1️⃣ `DebuggerAgent.py` **searches** `learning_db.json` for a prior fix.  
2️⃣ If a match is found ✅, it applies the fix.  
3️⃣ If no match ❌, it escalates to **AI-based debugging**.

### **🔹 Step 3: AI-Powered Fixing**
1️⃣ `AIAnalyzer.py` sends the issue to **Mistral / DeepSeek**.  
2️⃣ If local AI fails ❌, it falls back to **OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo**.  
3️⃣ AI suggests **a patch in unified diff format**.  
4️⃣ `PatchManager.py` applies the patch.

### **🔹 Step 4: Validating & Rolling Back**
1️⃣ `TestRunner.py` **re-runs the tests** after applying a fix.  
2️⃣ If the fix fails ❌, `PatchManager.py` **rolls back the changes**.  
3️⃣ If successful ✅, `DebuggerAgent.py` **saves the fix** to `learning_db.json` for future use.
