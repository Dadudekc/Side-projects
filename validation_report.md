# Validation Report

## Environment
- Python version: Python 3.12.10
- Installed dependencies from `Forges/VlogForge/requirements.txt`

## Test Results
All lightweight tests were executed:

```
pytest Forges/VlogForge/tests/test_content_manager.py \
       Forges/VlogForge/tests/test_engagement_tracker.py \
       Wizards/AI_Architect/tests/test_api.py \
       Wizards/AI_Architect/tests/test_code_generator.py \
       Wizards/AI_Architect/tests/test_project_manager.py \
       Wizards/api_wizard_project/tests/test_api_wizard.py \
       tests/test_tasks_json.py -q
```

Outcome:
- 16 passed, 1 warning
- Tests depending on Mailchimp credentials or advanced self-evolving logic were skipped.

## Manual Checks
- `python Forges/VlogForge/main.py` fails without `scipy` installed, indicating additional dependencies are required for full functionality.

## Recommendations
- Provide example `.env` for Mailchimp tests.
- Split projects into separate repositories for clarity.
- Expand unit tests for GUI applications.
