"""
The class 'AIPatchAnalyzer' has two static methods. The first method, 'analyze_failed_patch', takes two arguments 'error_signature' and 'patch'. It's a dummy implementation method that simulates analysis of a failed patch, and it returns a tuple containing an error message and a confidence level for a patch. The second method, 'modify_failed_patch', also takes two arguments 'error_signature' and 'patch'. This method generates and returns a modified version of the provided patch based on
