# SkillSwap

## Mission
SkillSwap empowers communities to share skills without money, breaking down economic barriers and fostering social connection.

## Social Issues Addressed
- **Economic inequality**: Provides free access to learning for under-resourced members.
- **Social isolation**: Builds local networks through one-on-one skill exchanges.
- **Access disparity**: Enables peer-to-peer tutoring where formal classes arenâ€™t available.

## What Makes Us Different
- **Barter-first**: Hour-for-hour exchanges (or point-backed swaps) instead of monetary transactions.
- **Local + Virtual**: Seamless hybrid matching for in-person or online skill trades.
- **Community-owned**: Users vote on new features and local partnerships.

## Long-Term Vision
- **Skill trees**: Gamified progression maps your growth and encourages challenges.
- **Institutional partnerships**: Co-hosted workshops with schools and libraries.
- **Global network**: Connect regions, share best practice-projects-projectss, and spotlight social impact metrics.
