"""
This module defines a CustomAgent class which acts as an artificial intelligence agent leveraging the capability to learn from and adapt to ongoing interactions with users. The agent uses a memory mechanism, managed by a contextual manager, to retrieve relevant responses based on historical user inputs or to store new interactions for future reference. The agent is designed to dynamically provide context-aware responses or learn from inputs where existing memory does not suffice.
