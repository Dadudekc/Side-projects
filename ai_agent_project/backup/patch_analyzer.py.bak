"""
This Python module defines the AIPatchAnalyzer class which is designed to analyze and modify failed patches in software or code deployment scenarios. The AIPatchAnalyzer evaluates patches that failed during application, identifying error messages and estimating the confidence of success for a potential modification. The class provides two main functionalities: analyzing a failed patch to extract an error message and a confidence score, and generating a modified patch based on the identified error signature and original patch content. These functionalities are aimed at assisting developers in debugging and
