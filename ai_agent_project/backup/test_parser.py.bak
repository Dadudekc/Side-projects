"""
This module defines a class, TestParser, that is specific for parsing test failures results from pytest output. 
The main functionality it offers is to extract and represent each test failure in a structured form (as a list of dictionaries), 
allowing easier downstream processing or analysis of the test cases and the associated failures.
