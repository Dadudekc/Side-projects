# API Wizard Product Requirements Document

## Purpose
API Wizard streamlines signups for third‑party APIs through a guided web interface and optional automation scripts. An AI assistant helps troubleshoot forms while background tasks handle automation when possible.

## Target Users
- Developers registering for multiple APIs
- Small teams needing consistent signup workflows

## Features
- Flask‑based wizard with forms for popular APIs (Twitter, GitHub, etc.)
- Automation layer using Selenium or Playwright to fill registration steps
- Asynchronous task processing via Celery
- AI assistant module for contextual help and troubleshooting
- Basic authentication and status tracking

## Success Metrics
- User completes registration for an API using the wizard
- Automation succeeds or falls back to manual steps gracefully
- Unit tests for routes and automation modules pass

## Out of Scope
- Full account management after signup
- Handling of APIs that block automation entirely

## Dependencies
- Python 3.12+
- Flask, Celery, Selenium/Playwright, AI API keys
