# API Wizard Roadmap

## Phase 1 – MVP
- Establish Flask app with basic forms
- Implement simple storage for API keys

## Phase 2 – Automation & Queue
- Add Selenium/Playwright scripts to automate signup flows
- Introduce Celery worker for asynchronous processing

## Phase 3 – AI Assistance
- Connect to AI service for troubleshooting tips
- Provide chatbot interface for FAQs

## Phase 4 – Testing and Documentation
- Expand unit and integration tests
- Publish user guide and developer docs

Beta release is expected after Phase 4 when at least one API flow runs end‑to‑end with automation fallback and documentation is complete.
