 hereâ€™s a comprehensive roadmap for **AI Architect** that aligns with your file layout and outlines the key milestones for development:

---

## ðŸš€ **AI Architect Roadmap**

### **Phase 1: Foundation (MVP)**
**Objective:** Establish the core structure and basic functionality.

- **Project Scaffolding & Structure**
  - **Completed:** Directory and file scaffold under `AI_Architect/` (as shown).
  - **Task:** Verify that all folders (`app/`, `tests/`, `scripts/`, etc.) are in place and properly configured.

- **API Setup**
  - **Files:**  
    - `app/main.py` â€“ Basic FastAPI entry point.
    - `app/api/v1/endpoints/project.py` â€“ Endpoint for project creation.
    - `app/api/v1/endpoints/self_improve.py` â€“ Endpoint to trigger self-improvement.
    - `app/api/v1/schemas.py` â€“ Data models for API communication.
  - **Task:** Implement and test the basic API endpoints to ensure a working "Hello World" version.

- **Core Modules Implementation**
  - **Files:**  
    - `app/core/project_manager.py` â€“ Logic to scaffold new projects.
    - `app/core/code_generator.py` â€“ Placeholder for AI-powered code generation.
    - `app/core/test_runner.py` â€“ Module to execute tests.
    - `app/core/self_evolver.py` â€“ Basic logic for self-improvement triggers.
  - **Task:** Develop simple placeholder implementations for each module with unit tests.

- **Initial Testing**
  - **Files:**  
    - `tests/test_project_manager.py`  
    - `tests/test_code_generator.py`  
    - `tests/test_self_evolver.py`  
    - `tests/test_api.py`
  - **Task:** Write and run basic tests to ensure that each module and endpoint returns expected responses.

---

### **Phase 2: Core Functionality Enhancement**
**Objective:** Expand on core features and integrate AI for code generation.

- **Advanced Code Generation**
  - **File:** `app/core/code_generator.py`
  - **Task:** Integrate with an AI API (like ChatGPT) to generate feature code snippets dynamically.
  - **Milestone:** Generate code based on given prompts and inject it into new project modules.

- **Self-Evolution Engine**
  - **File:** `app/core/self_evolver.py`
  - **Task:** Develop logic that analyzes the current codebase, identifies areas for improvement, and triggers self-improvement.
  - **Milestone:** Implement a feedback loop where the system suggests and applies code improvements.

- **Service Integration**
  - **File:** `app/services/ai_model.py`
  - **Task:** Create a service layer to handle requests to the AI model.  
  - **Milestone:** Enable a smooth integration where the code generator can request and receive improvements.

- **Utility Functions**
  - **File:** `app/utils/file_utils.py`
  - **Task:** Develop file management utilities to support dynamic file creation and modifications.

---

### **Phase 3: Automation & Deployment**
**Objective:** Automate self-improvement and prepare for production deployment.

- **Automation Scripts**
  - **Files:**  
    - `scripts/bootstrap_self.py` â€“ Script to run self-improvement cycles automatically.
    - `scripts/deploy.sh` â€“ Script for deployment (e.g., Docker Compose).
  - **Task:** Automate the process of running tests, generating new code, and deploying changes.
  
- **Testing and CI/CD Integration**
  - **Task:** Enhance the test suite in the `tests/` directory.
  - **Milestone:** Set up a CI/CD pipeline to run tests on every commit and auto-deploy successful builds.
  
- **Configuration & Environment Setup**
  - **Files:**  
    - `.env` â€“ Environment variables.
    - `requirements.txt` â€“ Python dependencies.
    - `docker-compose.yml` â€“ Containerization setup.
  - **Task:** Finalize configuration files for production readiness.

---

### **Phase 4: Scaling & Advanced Features**
**Objective:** Scale the system and add advanced self-evolving capabilities.

- **Multi-Project Management**
  - **Folder:** `projects/`
  - **Task:** Extend the project manager to handle multiple projects and ensure isolation between them.

- **Plugin & Extension System**
  - **Task:** Develop a modular plugin system that allows third-party integrations or custom features.
  - **Milestone:** Create a marketplace or repository of plugins that can be automatically integrated.

- **Self-Directed Learning**
  - **Task:** Implement mechanisms for AI Architect to learn from its own performance and adjust its code-generation prompts over time.
  - **Milestone:** Achieve full self-improvement where the system requires minimal manual intervention.

- **User Interface & Developer Tools (Optional)**
  - **Task:** Build dashboards or CLI tools to visualize system performance, generated code, and improvement cycles.
  - **Milestone:** Enhance usability for developers and potential collaborators.

---

### **Timeline Overview**

- **Phase 1 (Foundation/MVP):** 1â€“2 months  
- **Phase 2 (Core Functionality Enhancement):** 2â€“3 months  
- **Phase 3 (Automation & Deployment):** 1â€“2 months  
- **Phase 4 (Scaling & Advanced Features):** 3+ months (ongoing refinement)

---

This roadmap provides a step-by-step guide to evolving **AI Architect** from a foundational MVP to a robust, self-evolving system. Adjust milestones and timelines as needed based on development progress and feedback. 

Let me know if you need any further details or adjustments to this roadmap!
