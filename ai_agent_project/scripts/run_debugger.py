"""

This script allows you to run an AI-Powered Self-Healing Debugging System. The script imports the necessary tools from the core, logger and config utils and initializes the DebuggerAgent. The Agent is then run and begins fixing failing tests.

The script also sets up a logger for managing log messages and a configuration object for setting up configurable settings or options. 

Each of the aforementioned processes are consolidated within a main function, which is readily executed when the script is run.
