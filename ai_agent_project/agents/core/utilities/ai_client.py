"""

This module provides the AIClient class which includes multiple AI-based methods to be used in the debugging workflow such as sending prompts to a real or simulated AI service, evaluating a code patch for correctness, and automatically improving a patch.

The AI Client class uses two important configurations:
- The API endpoint for a real AI service.
- An API key for authenticating with a real AI service.

These configurations are optional and if no real endpoint is configured, it returns a simulated response.
