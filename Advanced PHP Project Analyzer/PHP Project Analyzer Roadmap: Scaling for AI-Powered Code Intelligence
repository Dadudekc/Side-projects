### **PHP Project Analyzer Roadmap: Scaling for AI-Powered Code Intelligence**

---

### **Phase 1: Foundation & Refactoring (Weeks 1-4)**
**Goals:** Modularize the current codebase, improve performance, and prepare for AI integration.

- **1.1 Modular Architecture:**  
  - Refactor existing script into core modules: *Parser Engine*, *Data Storage*, *API Layer*.
  - Ensure each module is loosely coupled for easy upgrades.

- **1.2 Database Integration:**  
  - Implement SQLite for local data storage (PostgreSQL for scalability).
  - Design schema for storing files, classes, functions, constants, etc.

- **1.3 Enhanced CLI & Config:**  
  - Add config files (JSON/YAML) to support customizable analysis.
  - Improve CLI with commands for re-analysis, querying, and exporting data.

---

### **Phase 2: API Development & Asynchronous Processing (Weeks 5-8)**
**Goals:** Build APIs for interaction and enable faster processing for large codebases.

- **2.1 REST API Development:**  
  - Use FastAPI to create RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations on code data.
  - Secure endpoints with basic authentication for future SaaS models.

- **2.2 Asynchronous Processing:**  
  - Integrate `asyncio` for non-blocking I/O operations.
  - Use Celery + Redis for background job processing (for large projects).

- **2.3 API Documentation:**  
  - Auto-generate API docs using Swagger/OpenAPI for easy developer onboarding.

---

### **Phase 3: AI Agent Integration (Weeks 9-12)**
**Goals:** Integrate an AI-powered agent to query and analyze codebases intelligently.

- **3.1 Natural Language Query Engine:**  
  - Integrate OpenAI GPT (or similar) for converting user queries into SQL/API calls.
  - Example: "List all functions without comments" ‚Üí SQL Query ‚Üí Results.

- **3.2 Code Insight Generator:**  
  - Implement an AI module to suggest refactoring opportunities, detect code smells, etc.
  - Provide risk assessments for security vulnerabilities.

- **3.3 Feedback Loop:**  
  - Allow users to rate AI suggestions to improve model accuracy over time.

---

### **Phase 4: Web-Based Dashboard (Weeks 13-16)**
**Goals:** Create an interactive UI for users to visualize and interact with their code data.

- **4.1 Dashboard Development:**  
  - Use React or Next.js to build a responsive dashboard.
  - Features: Code explorer, search filters, AI query interface, data visualizations.

- **4.2 Visual Code Analytics:**  
  - Add visualizations like dependency graphs, function call hierarchies, and code heatmaps.

- **4.3 User Authentication:**  
  - Implement user accounts for personalized experiences.
  - Set up roles (admin, developer, guest) with different access levels.

---

### **Phase 5: Scalability & Deployment (Weeks 17-20)**
**Goals:** Prepare the platform for production, cloud deployment, and SaaS capabilities.

- **5.1 Microservices Architecture:**  
  - Break down core components into Dockerized microservices.
  - Use Kubernetes for orchestration if scaling horizontally.

- **5.2 Cloud Deployment:**  
  - Deploy on AWS/GCP with CI/CD pipelines for seamless updates.
  - Add monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana) for performance insights.

- **5.3 SaaS Readiness:**  
  - Introduce multi-tenancy support for future SaaS offerings.
  - Implement billing/invoicing systems if monetizing.

---

### **Future Enhancements (Beyond 20 Weeks):**
- **Multi-Language Support:** Add analyzers for Python, JavaScript, etc.
- **Advanced AI Models:** Fine-tune models for specific code review tasks.
- **IDE Plugins:** Create extensions for VS Code, JetBrains, etc., for real-time feedback.
- **Marketplace Integration:** Allow third-party plugins to enhance the analyzer's capabilities.

---

### **Key Milestones:**
- ‚úÖ **Phase 1:** Modular Core & Database Ready
